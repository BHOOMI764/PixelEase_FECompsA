        These architects and architecture studios stand out with websites that are a cut above the rest.
        
        The best-designed architecture portfolios show off a variety of projects in a way that complements, rather than distracting from, the work. Especially for emerging architects looking to connect with new clients or get noticed by established firms, a well-made online portfolio website is an indispensable tool.
        
    
        
        Based in Australia, architect Nicholas Gurney specializes in design for small spaces, as demonstrated by the XS – SML label at the top of his portfolio. With ample white space, Gurney’s architecture portfolio is designed with the same minimalism he applies to his interiors. A grid overview shows previews of each project, and clicking through opens up a gallery with images that show each commission in more detail.</h3>
